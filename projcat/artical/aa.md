# How to Keep a Cat if You Are Allergic to Cats

You can live with a cat if you are allergic, unless you have severe allergies. In fact, thousands of people with allergies do live with their feline friends. Some who only have mild symptoms just put up with the symptoms or treat them with over-the-counter medicine. Those with moderate symptoms often seek help from a doctor who may prescribe prescription medications.


It's tough to miss cat allergy symptoms. They tend to happen whenever there's a feline nearby or you've encountered some cat hair lingering on furniture. Your body's immune system is reacting to the proteins that are found in a cat's urine, saliva, or dander. Here is a list of typical cat allergy symptoms you may experience:


- Sneezing
- Coughing
- Wheezing
- Skin rash
- Nasal congestion
- Trouble breathing
- Runny/stuffed nose
- Itchy, red, watery eyes


Very rarely, people with a cat allergy can develop a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis makes it difficult to breathe, can lower blood pressure to dangerous levels, and can send the body into shock.
A person who is allergic to cats may continue to have symptoms even after the cat is no longer present. That happens because cat dander and other cat allergens can land on furniture and rugs, remain on unwashed clothes, and linger in linens.

People with allergies who want to live with cats or visit homes that have cats can do several things to manage their symptoms. Trying these can help alleviate the severity of allergies.

- Talk to a doctor about allergy treatments: Inhalers can reduce the risk of an asthma attack. Some nasal sprays can also help. Some people find that antihistamines reduce symptoms.


- Consider allergy shots: Allergy shots, sometimes called immunotherapy, gradually desensitize the immune system to particular allergens. By exposing the body to very small amounts of allergens over time, these shots can reduce the severity of allergic reactions.
- Do not use carpets or rugs, since they can trap pet allergens: Low pile carpet may reduce symptoms in houses that must use carpeting.
- Keep pets out of specific areas: These include bedrooms, off of furniture, and out of bed.
- Grooming: Have the cat regularly groomed, and ask someone who does not have allergies to brush them.
- Use air conditioning to filter the air: HEPA air cleaners can help with removing allergens.
- Vacuum: Use a microfilter bag in the vacuum to prevent cat allergens from traveling back into the air.
- Avoid hugging or kissing cats: Wash hands after petting them.
- Regularly vacuum furniture and carpets and sweep the floors: If possible, have someone who does not have pet allergies do these chores.
- Carry an epinephrine injection pen: For those who have more severe reactions to cats, talk to your doctor about whether an epinephrine pen is an option. This can be used to treat severe allergic reactions should someone come into unplanned contact with an allergen.




There are a few breeds of cats considered to be hypoallergenic, or at least helpful to those with allergies, including the following breeds:
- Sphynx: These cats have very fine, sparse hair.
- Rex: Certain rex breeds, like the Devon Rex have fine, wavy or curly hair that may not trap dander the way thicker coats do.
- Siberian: These cats lack the Fel d 1 protein in their saliva that becomes dander after grooming, a characteristic that may be good for those with allergies.

# How To Clean a Cat's Litter Box


Poor litter box maintenance is often to blame for a cat's mishaps. Cats hate dirty litter boxes and may be driven to search for substitutes, whether that's a corner of the carpet or a basket of clean laundry in the closet. Your cat's sense of smell is 14 times stronger than yours, so a litter box that smells reasonably clean to you may outright stink to your cat.

The No. 1 rule, and the only thing that will keep litter box odor at bay, is constant cleaning. That means scooping the box out at least twice a day, removing the solids and liquid clumps if you use clumping litter.

For those who don’t use clumping litter, use a large, solid metal spoon (such as a large kitchen spoon) to lift out the most urine-soaked areas each time you clean. Add litter as needed to replace what is removed.

Also wash the box weekly, or every other week if you are using clumping litter. Use a mild, unscented dish detergent or a mild bleach spray (20 parts water to one part bleach) and rinse well. Clean your scooper also.


## Type of Litter
Some litters have perfumes or other additives that claim to help cover litter smell. But to a cat these can smell overwhelming and make the box unwelcoming. Most veterinarians advise against using these products.

## Type of Box
Almost any easily cleaned plastic container can be used as a litter box, but buy the largest box your home can accommodate. A rule of thumb is to get a box that is at least twice as long as your adult cat and as wide as the cat is long.

And avoid covered boxes. Most cats don’t like them, and they can trap odors inside, making it unpleasant for your pet to enter.

## Box Location
The rule is one litter box per cat, plus one. So if you have one cat, you need two boxes. If you have four cats, you need five boxes.

Keep the boxes in different locations in your home. If a cat is on the third floor, and the box is in the basement, they may decide not to make the long trek.

Also, choose the right spots for your litter boxes. Don’t put a box in a small, enclosed area, like a tiny bathroom or closet, which will concentrate litter box odors. A larger, well-ventilated area is best. But it needs to be in a quiet, low-traffic area, away from your cat’s food, other pets, and anything that can startle or scare your cat while they are using the box.

# Indoor vs. Outdoor

Deciding if your cat is going to live completely indoors or spend some time outdoors requires careful consideration on your part. First, you need to know the benefits and risks associated with each lifestyle for your cat, and for your family. Then you need to decide what you will be best based on:

- Where you live.
- Health needs of your cat.
- Activity or behavioral needs of your cat.
- Recommendations from your veterinarian.
- Benefits and risks listed below.

Wherever your cat spends most of his time, it is important to make sure he can enjoy natural cat activities such as: scratching, hunting, stalking, and catching prey (real or pretend). This is important to think about because when cats are kept entirely indoors, they can become bored, fearful, and/or anxious if their needs are not met. This can lead to unwanted behavior, such as scratching of furniture or not using the litter box. It is essential to make sure your cat has an enriched environment to meet their needs.

Please speak with your veterinarian to get guidance on how to make sure your cat’s emotional, social, and environmental needs are being met. Once you understand the benefits and risks of an indoor-only or indoor/outdoor lifestyle for your cat, you can minimize the risks and maximize the benefits for your cat.
## Indoor Cat
Benefits
- Less risk of injury since your cat is not exposed to outdoor dangers.
- Less risk of poisoning from places and sources that are not monitored.
- Less risk of human abuse or theft.
- Less risk of contagious diseases and parasites.
- Less exposure and risk from predators and wildlife.
- Increased protection from extreme hot and cold temperatures, and dangerous weather conditions.

Risks

- Less able to express normal behaviors of hunting, playing, and scratching that satisfy cats’ physical, social, and emotional needs.
- Increased risk of boredom.
- Lack of stimulation.
- Increased risk of obesity.
- Less likely to have preventive treatments for parasites and contagious diseases because many people think that indoor cats cannot get these diseases.
- Increased risk of stress-associated diseases (lower urinary tract diseases, upper respiratory infections, gastrointestinal diseases).

## Indoor/Outdoor Cat
Benefits
- Access to the outdoors allows your cat to participate in normal activities including: development of territory, scratching, choices for toileting, and ability to urine-and scent-mark.
- Increased activity and exercise can improve your cat’s physical, social, and emotional health, and reduce their risk of stress-related behaviors.
- Access to a more stimulating lifestyle addresses all of their senses (smell, taste, touch, hearing, and sight).
- Cats are more likely to get preventive treatments for contagious diseases and parasites.
Risks
- More risk of injury due to exposure from outdoor dangers.
- More risk of poisoning from places and sources that aren’t monitored.
- More risk of danger from wildlife and other animals.
- More risk of human abuse and theft.
- More exposure to contagious diseases and parasites.
- Exposure to hot and cold temperature extremes and dangerous weather conditions.

## Creating a Safe Outdoor Environment for Your Cat
The American Association of Feline Practitioners (AAFP) believes an indoor/outdoor lifestyle for cats in a safe environment can keep away most dangers, and provide a more stimulating place for cats to participate in natural activities. Creating a safe outdoor environment can include walking your cat with a harness and leash, having an outdoor enclosure where your cat can roam freely, and having a fenced-in or invisible fence around your property.
If your cat goes outdoors, to improve safety from predators it is recommended that your cat go out during the day and is kept indoors (or in an outdoor enclosure with indoor access) at night. A safe environment can include walking your cat on a harness and leash, having an outdoor enclosure where your cat can roam freely, and having a fenced-in or invisible fence around your property. Young cats and male cats are more likely to engage in activities that increase their risk of injury, and should be monitored more closely.
Indoor-only living is an option, but you will need to work a bit harder to ensure all of your cat’s physical, emotional, and social needs are being met. Speak with your veterinarian for guidance on how to meet all of your cat’s needs including:
- Appropriate play and exercise
- Ability to simulate foraging and hunting
- A safe territory with vertical space
- Appropriate and clean toileting areas
